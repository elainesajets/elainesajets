# Hello, I’m Elaine 👋

I’m currently learning game development, focusing on **Unity and C#**. Also planning on learning more about .NET and 2D game development in Game Maker.  

I've recently completed Unity's Junior Programmer pathway and continuing my learning journey with GameDev and their Unity courses.

Alongside Unity, I’ve also learned the basics of **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, and I enjoy experimenting with different technologies to understand how games and interactive experiences are built.  

🌱 **Currently learning:** Unity • C# • JavaScript • HTML • CSS (using Git/Github for projects)  
🎮 **Interests:** Game development and game design  
📍 Norwegian, currently based in South Korea
