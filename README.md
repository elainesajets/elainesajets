## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<div align="center">I'm currently learning web development through The Odin Project. I'm currently 93% done with the Foundations course and will soon start the Full Stack Javascript path. 

I have a masterâ€™s degree in Information Systems and originally started my career in project management. While I had a great experienceâ€”especially at my first companyâ€”Iâ€™ve discovered a passion for programming and am now transitioning into web development.

Let's connect!
