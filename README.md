# Hello, I’m Elaine 👋

I’m currently transitioning into game development, focusing on **Unity and C#**.  
I’m working through Unity’s Junior Programmer pathway and building small prototypes as I go.  

Alongside Unity, I’ve also learned the basics of **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, and I enjoy experimenting with different technologies to understand how games and interactive experiences are built.  

🌱 **Currently learning:** Unity • C# • JavaScript • HTML • CSS (using Git/Github for projects)  
🎮 **Interests:** Game development and game design
📍 Norwegian, currently based in South Korea
